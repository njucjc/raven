# Raven Agent Tutorial

This document introduces how to install raven and use raven to enhance edge-edge and edge-cloud network communication in an edge cluster.

Suppose you have an edge kubernetes cluster with nodes in different physical regions, and already deploy the yurt-manager in this cluster, the details of yurt-manager are in [here](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/blob/master/cmd/yurt-manager/README.md).

## Label nodes in different physical regions

As follows, suppose the cluster has five nodes, located in three different regions, where the node `master` is cloud node.

``` bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

NAME         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    
hhht-node1   Ready    <none>   20d   v1.16.2   10.48.115.9    
hhht-node2   Ready    <none>   20d   v1.16.2   10.48.115.10
master       Ready    master   20d   v1.16.2   10.48.115.8
wlcb-node1   Ready    <none>   20d   v1.16.2   10.48.115.11
wlcb-node2   Ready    <none>   20d   v1.16.2   10.48.115.12    
```

We use a [Gateway](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/blob/master/pkg/apis/raven/v1alpha1/gateway_types.go) CR to manage nodes in different physical regions, and label nodes to indicate which `Gateway` these nodes are managed by.

For example, We label nodes in region `cn-huhehaote` with value `gw-hhht`, indicating that these nodes are managed by the `gw-hhht` gateway.

```bash
$ kubectl label nodes hhht-node1 hhht-node2 raven.openyurt.io/gateway=gw-hhht
hhht-node1 labeled
hhht-node2 labeled
```

Similarly, we label node in `cloud` with value `gw-cloud`, and nodes in region `cn-wulanchabu` with value `gw-wlcb`.

```bash
$ kubectl label nodes master raven.openyurt.io/gateway=gw-cloud
master labeled
```

```bash
$ kubectl label nodes wlcb-node1 wlcb-node2 raven.openyurt.io/gateway=gw-wlcb
wlcb-node1 labeled
wlcb-node2 labeled
```

### install raven agent

- Run the following commands:

```bash
cd raven
make deploy
```

- Open the UDP port 4500 on gateway nodes.

Wait for the raven agent daemon to be created successfully

``` bash
$ kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep raven-agent-ds
raven-agent-ds-2jw47                           1/1     Running   0          91s
raven-agent-ds-bq8zc                           1/1     Running   0          91s
raven-agent-ds-cj7k4                           1/1     Running   0          91s
raven-agent-ds-p9fk9                           1/1     Running   0          91s
raven-agent-ds-rlb9q                           1/1     Running   0          91s
```

## How to Use

### Gateways

- 1 create gateways

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: raven.openyurt.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gw-hhht
spec:
  endpoints:
    - nodeName: hhht-node1
      underNAT: true
      
---
apiVersion: raven.openyurt.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gw-cloud
spec:
  endpoints:
    - nodeName: master
      underNAT: false
      
---
apiVersion: raven.openyurt.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gw-wlcb
spec:
  endpoints:
    - nodeName: wlcb-node1
      underNAT: true

EOF
```

NOTE: Only candidate gateway node should be entered to endpoints slice in `Gateway CR`.

- 2 Get gateways

```bash
$ kubectl get gateways

NAME      ACTIVEENDPOINT
gw-hhht   hhht-node1
gw-master master
gw-wlcb   wlcb-node1
```

### Test pod-to-pod networking

- 1 Create test pod

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fedora-1
spec:
  nodeName: hhht-node2
  containers:
    - name: fedora
      image: njucjc/fedora:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fedora-2
spec:
  nodeName: wlcb-node2
  containers:
    - name: fedora
      image: njucjc/fedora:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always


EOF
```

- 2 Get test pod

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -o wide
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE                  NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
fedora-1   1/1     Running   0          46s     10.14.10.67   hhht-node2            <none>           <none>
fedora-2   1/1     Running   0          46s     10.14.2.70    wlcb-node2            <none>           <none>

```

- 3 Test networking across edge

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it fedora-1 -- bash
[root@fedora-1]# ping 10.14.2.70 -c 4

```

## (Optional 1) Enable node IP forward

By default, raven only forward cross-edge traffic of container network. If you also want to forward the network traffic of edge nodes. You can run the following command:

```bash
cd raven
make undeploy
FORWARD_NODE_IP=true make deploy
```

NOTE: Make sure there are no node IP conflicts in the cluster.

## (Optional 2) Use WireGuard as VPN backend

By default, raven uses IPSec as VPN backend, we also provide [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) as an alternative. You can switch to WireGuard backend by the following steps:

- Raven requires the WireGuard kernel module to be loaded on gateway nodes in the cluster. Starting at Linux 5.6, the kernel includes WireGuard in-tree; Linux distributions with older kernels will need to install WireGuard. For most Linux distributions, this can be done using the system package manager. For more information, see [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).
- The gateway nodes will require an open UDP port in order to communicate. By default, we use UDP port 4500.
- Run the following commands:

```bash
cd raven
make undeploy
VPN_DRIVER=wireguard make deploy
```

## (Optional 3) Use LoadBalancer to expose cloud gateway VPN service

By default, raven use EIP/Public IP to expose cloud gateway VPN service, we also provide LoadBalancer as an alternative. You can set `exposeType: LoadBalancer` in Gateway CR to enable it.

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: raven.openyurt.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gw-cloud
spec:
  exposeType: LoadBalancer
  endpoints:
    - nodeName: master
      underNAT: false
```
